* Literate Configuration

I configure emacs using [[http://orgmode.org][~org-mode~]], a plain-text format and emacs major
mode.

You can see the configuration in ~emacs.org~, which is compiled and loaded
by ~init.el~.

* Other requirements

The ~marked~ markdown compiler. ~opam~ and ~ocp-indent~ are required for OCaml work.
